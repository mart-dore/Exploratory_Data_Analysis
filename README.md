# Exploratory Data Analysis Project

## 📚 Overview

This project involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and was completed as part of my studies at the **University of Miguel Hernandez of Elche** (that is why report is in spanish). The project covers various analytical techniques such as **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, **clustering**, **factor analysis**, **missing data analysis**, and **outlier detection**. The code is provided in an RMarkdown file, and a detailed report is available in PDF format.

## 🛠 Files and Directories

- **Data/**: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- **entregable_dore.rmd**: This RMarkdown file includes the EDA code, which covers:
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Clustering techniques
  - Factor analysis
  - Missing data analysis
  - Outlier detection and treatment
- **entregable_dore.pdf**: A comprehensive report generated from the `.rmd` file, providing a detailed explanation of the exercise and results.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository URL]
   ```

2. Open **entregable_dore.rmd** in RStudio to explore the EDA code.
   ```bash
   cd [repository]/entregable_dore.rmd
   ```

3. For a detailed explanation of the analysis, you can refer to the **entregable_dore.pdf** in the root directory.
   ```bash
   open entregable_dore.pdf
   ```
